# Robust Statistics - M Estimator

## Overview
This repository focuses on robust statistical methods, specifically M-estimators, implemented using the R programming language. M-estimators are a class of robust estimators commonly used in statistics for parameter estimation, emphasizing resistance to outliers.

## Contents
- **Code:** This directory contains R scripts and Jupyter notebooks illustrating the implementation and application of M-estimators.
- **Data:** Sample datasets used in the M-estimator examples.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/samrat1699/robust-statistics-m-estimator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd robust-statistics-m-estimator`
3. Explore the code examples and datasets in the respective directories.

## Prerequisites
- R 
- RStudio (optional but recommended for an interactive R environment)
- Jupyter-colab

## Usage
1. Open RStudio or your preferred R environment.
2. Open the relevant R script or Jupyter notebook.
3. Execute the code to see examples of M-estimators in action.
